### 2023

## Deep Sea Coral Reefs, Galapagos.

[Galapagos Deep 2023 research cruise](https://galapagosdeep2023.com)

Working primarily with the Biology and Mapping teams, I assisted with taking live biology samples, that would be analysed for taxonomy, genetics and population connectivity.
Biology, Data Management and Mapping teams.

**Skills:** biological sampling, multi-beam mapping - data acquisition and processing, data management, USBL data, human operated submersible - sampling deep sea environments for biology and geology, seafaring research cruise

### 2019 

## Coral reefs & Mangrove lagoons, Seychelles.

Curieuse Marine National Park, Seychelles with University of Essex in partnership with Earthwatch. 

Assisted with the long-term monitoring of the local reefs including benthic and fish surveys. Implemented 3D coral modelling project and establishing new coral nurseries. 

Assisted fellow PhD candidate with coral trans-location fieldwork in coral reef and mangrove lagoons and water sampling for nutrient loading analysis. 

**Skills:** 3D coral modelling, establishing a coral nursery, water sample collection and in-field processing. 

### 2016, 2017 & 2018 

## Coral reefs, Mangroves and Seagrass beds, Indonesia.

Based in the Wakatobi marine national park, Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia working with Operation Wallacea, and studying at University of Essex.

Supervised research students, taught coral reef ecology, fish and coral identification, introduction to mangroves and seagrass beds. Alongside, long-term monitoring of reefs in terms of benthic and fish surveys. 

Master by research project on the "Functional niche partitioning in herbivorous coral reef fishes". Conducted a low tech field experiment, using exclusion cages across the depths of the reef to monitor the functional roles of herbivores on algae controlling algae communities. 

**Skills:** Underwater research techniques, supervision and mentoring, teaching, diving logistics, in-field analysis logistics. 

### 2013

## Mangrove Forests, Zanzibar

Research project for MSc Marine Biology, Bangor University Wales in conjunction with the Institute of Marine Science, Zanzibar; University of Dar Es Salaam, entitled “The effect of tidal setting on carbon delivery in mangrove forests on Unguja Island, Zanzibar”.

Focused on investigating carbon sequestration into sediments across the tidal range in mangrove forests in Zanzibar. This was a 2 month long expedition, where I measured descriptive features of mangrove trees and composition of species, sampled shallow sediment cores, leaf litter. Including calculating potential carbon stocks, organic matter and dry bulk density of soil. 

**Skills:** C/N analysis with Carlo-Erba NA-1500 Elemental Analyser, Loss of ignition for organic matter calculations, grain size, Malvern Mastersizer 2000 for particle size analysis, 

### Mudflats, Shell Island, North Cardigan Bay, Wales

Mudflat habitat and biodiversity monitoring, to determine physical, biological, identify and map biotopes and, potential anthropogenic impacts. 

### 2012

## Coral reefs, Fiji 

Research assistant internship, marine conservation project with Frontier. 

### 2009

## National Parks, Tanzania

Conservation and Management methods – large mammal surveys, management of national parks in collaboration with Mweka Wildlife College.

## Laurel forests, Madeira, Portugal 

Self-directed laurel forest monitoring project 

### 2008 

### Laurel forests, Madeira, Portugal 

Conservation methods: Laurel Forest monitoring, endemic population surveys (pipit transects, mark, capture and release).
