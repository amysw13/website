### 2019 

## Coral reefs & Mangrove lagoons, Seychelles.

Curieuse Marine National Park, Seychelles with University of Essex in partnership with Earthwatch. 

Assisted with the long-term monitoring of the local reefs including benthic and fish surveys. Implemented 3D coral modelling project and establishing new coral nurseries. 

Assisted fellow PhD candidate with coral trans-location fieldwork in coral reef and mangrove lagoons and water sampling for nutrient loading analysis. 

{{< icon name="cog" pack="fas" >}}**Skills:** 3D coral modelling, establishing a coral nursery, water sample collection and in-field processing.

### 2016, 2017 & 2018 

## Coral reefs, Mangroves and Seagrass beds, Indonesia.

Based in the Wakatobi marine national park, Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia working with Operation Wallacea, and studying at University of Essex.

Supervised research students, taught coral reef ecology, fish and coral identification, introduction to mangroves and seagrass beds. Alongside, long-term monitoring of reefs in terms of benthic and fish surveys. 

Master by research project on the "Functional niche partitioning in herbivorous coral reef fishes". Conducted a low tech field experiment, using exclusion cages across the depths of the reef to monitor the functional roles of herbivores on algae controlling algae communities. 

{{< icon name="cog" pack="fas" >}}**Skills:** Underwater research techniques, supervision and mentoring, teaching, diving logistics, in-field analysis logistics.

### 2013

## Mangrove Forests, Zanzibar

Research project for MSc Marine Biology, Bangor University Wales in conjunction with the Institute of Marine Science, Zanzibar; University of Dar Es Salaam, entitled “The effect of tidal setting on carbon delivery in mangrove forests on Unguja Island, Zanzibar”.

Focused on investigating carbon sequestration into sediments across the tidal range in mangrove forests in Zanzibar. This was a 2 month long expedition, where I measured descriptive features of mangrove trees and composition of species, sampled shallow sediment cores, leaf litter. Including calculating potential carbon stocks, organic matter and dry bulk density of soil. 

{{< icon name="cog" pack="fas" >}}**Skills:** C/N analysis with Carlo-Erba NA-1500 Elemental Analyser, Loss of ignition for organic matter calculations, grain size, Malvern Mastersizer 2000 for particle size analysis,
