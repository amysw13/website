  I am a marine ecologist with a particular interest in tropical coastal ecosystems and extending to deep-sea environments. Focusing on the intersection of people and nature and how data can inform policy and conservation. I obtained my PhD from the [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk), UK in the [TaylorLab](https://taylorlab.science), funded by the faculty research studentship within the School of Life Sciences, and School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science. 
  
  My research “Temporal global trends of human population and dependency on coral reefs”, focused on updating statistics and creating a long-term dataset of human populations near coral reefs. I also developed a human dependency framework, which utilises open access data to model human dependency on coral reefs and is designed to be reproducible and adaptable to newly available data. 
  
  My research is aimed to improve coral science with facilitating human aspects to research, furthermore create more informed decision making to policymakers in distributing funds and resources. Additionally, to facilitate a novel tool of insurance as a form of climate resilience, for coral reefs the humans that depend on them.
  
  Previous research experience included animal laboratory studies of the fecundity of the European speckled wood butterfly (_Pararge aegeria_), without the presence of male harassment. I have extensive field work experience in tropical marine ecosystems having researched the mangrove forests of Zanzibar and the coral reefs of the Wakatobi National Park, Indonesia. Most recently, I was apart of the Galapagos Deep research cruise, where my role spanned multiple teams, managing data input and collation, data acquisition and processing of multibeam data and assisting with live biology sampling.
