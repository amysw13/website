## Teaching

Working as a graduate laboratory assistant during my time at the University of Essex. I have demonstrated on a number of practicals out in the field, labs, computer labs and online. 

#### Modules: 
  - population demography
  - biological and physical processes of estuaries
  - biology of reef-building corals
  - marine ecology
  - GIS
  - remote sensing data manipulation
  - Bioinformatics
  - Introduction to R

This included [**remote sensing data manipulation**](https://github.com/amysw13/Remote_sensing_GIS_coral_bleaching) a course I helped develop for a self-directed learning module that was taught online. 


## Student supervision

In multiple roles on marine expeditions with Operation Wallacea based in Indonesia, I taught coral reef ecology to school groups and supervised students on summer research projects at both masters and undergraduate levels.

Research projects supervised
  - Functional ecology of coral reefs
  - Are mutualistic relationships the norm?
  - The feeding behaviour of herbivorous fish and their role in maintaining reefs.
  - Fisheries research in local communities

I developed research projects for undergraduate and master's tropical marine biology research projects. 

All student supervision roles listed below were in the capacity of co-supervisor.

## Outreach


#### Pint of Science, Colchester, 2018

A member of the [Pint of Science](https://pintofscience.co.uk), Colchester coordinating team, within the Planet Earth team. Contacted potential speakers and curated the Planet Earth themed evening talks, along with additional activities to engage the public. 


#### The Reef & Me, Maldives, 2016

The project launched with Park Hyatt, Maldives in partnership with a newly established Maldivian NGO Biodiversity, Education and Awareness Maldives (BEAM), Parley and Adidas. Guests speakers from all partners provided talks at the local school along with interactive activities to provide awareness about the coral reef ecosystems that surround their home islands. This was to encourage locals and in particular girls to enter the water and discover the ecosystem for themselves; in hope that future generations of the Maldives become passionate about their marine world and become marine biologist themselves. Additional awareness about marine plastics and how large corporate brands can assist and cooperate with reducing and clearing the amount of marine plastics washed up on to islands found in the Maldives.
