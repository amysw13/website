### Teaching

Working as a graduate laboratory assistant during my time at the University of Essex. I have demonstrated on a number of practicals out in the field, labs, computer labs and online. 

#### Modules: 
  - population demography
  - biological and physical processes of estuaries
  - biology of reef-building corals
  - marine ecology
  - GIS
  - remote sensing data manipulation
  - Bioinformatics
  - Introduction to R

This included [**remote sensing data manipulation**](https://github.com/amysw13/Remote_sensing_GIS_coral_bleaching) a course I helped develop for a self-directed learning module that was taught online. 


### Student supervision

In multiple roles on marine expeditions with Operation Wallacea based in Indonesia, I taught coral reef ecology to school groups and supervised students on summer research projects at both masters and undergraduate levels.

Research projects supervised
  - Functional ecology of coral reefs
  - Are mutualistic relationships the norm?
  - The feeding behaviour of herbivorous fish and their role in maintaining reefs.
  - Fisheries research in local communities

I developed research projects for undergraduate and master's tropical marine biology research projects. 

All student supervision roles listed below were in the capacity of co-supervisor.
