### Outreach


#### Pint of Science, Colchester, 2018

A member of the [Pint of Science](https://pintofscience.co.uk), Colchester coordinating team, within the Planet Earth team. Contacted potential speakers and curated the Planet Earth themed evening talks, along with additional activities to engage the public. 


#### The Reef & Me, Maldives, 2016

The project launched with Park Hyatt, Maldives in partnership with a newly established Maldivian NGO Biodiversity, Education and Awareness Maldives (BEAM), Parley and Adidas. Guests speakers from all partners provided talks at the local school along with interactive activities to provide awareness about the coral reef ecosystems that surround their home islands. This was to encourage locals and in particular girls to enter the water and discover the ecosystem for themselves; in hope that future generations of the Maldives become passionate about their marine world and become marine biologist themselves. Additional awareness about marine plastics and how large corporate brands can assist and cooperate with reducing and clearing the amount of marine plastics washed up on to islands found in the Maldives.
